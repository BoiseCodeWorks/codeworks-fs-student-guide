# JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

## Data and Structure types
<hr>

**Number**: 1, 75, 1000000, 0.99, -13

**String**: "whatevs", "Banana", "x0Xl33tH4x3rX0x"

**Boolean**: true, false

**undefined**: 

**Null**: the value of no value. 

**Object**: Objects can be seen as a collection of properties.  Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures. Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a String or a Symbol value.
{key: value}, 
{myNumber: 12, myName: 'Mark'}

**Array**: Arrays are a collection of 'elements'. each element can be of any data type (including arrays) and these elements are accessed by their 'index' or their position in the array.  these indexes start at 0 and increase for each element in the array.  
[2,4,6,8], ['Mark','Jake', 'D$']


## Comparison Opperators

these opperators are used to determine a 'truthy' or 'falsy' value.  these can be used in conjunction with other statements to run or not run certain lines of code under certain conditions.
<ul>
<li>== is equal</li>
<li>!= is not equal</li>
<li>=== strictly equals</li>
<li>> greater than</li>
<li>< less than</li>
<li>>= greater than or equal too</li>
<li><= less than or equal too</li>
