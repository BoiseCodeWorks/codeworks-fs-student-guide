### Change the way you interact with Objects

> Proxies are Middleware for Javascript Objects

... or at least that's sort of the tl;dr version for it.

Proxies were introduced in ES6 to allow you to provide *custom* functionality to basic operations that can be performed on an `Object`. For example, `get` is a basic `Object` operation.
```javascript
const obj = {
   val: 10
};
console.log(obj.val);
```
Here, the `console.log()` statement performs a `get` operation on the object `obj` to get the value of the key `val`.

Another basic Object operation is `set`.
```javascript
const obj = {
   val: 10
};
obj.val2 = 20;
```
Here, a `set` operation is performed to set a new key to the object `obj`.

## How do I create a Proxy?
```javascript
const proxiedObject = new Proxy(initialObj, handler);
```
Calling the Proxy constructor, `new Proxy()`, will return an object that has the values contained in `initialObj` but whose basic operations like `get` and `set`, now have some custom logic specified by the `handler` object.

Let's take an example to understand this,
```javascript
const handler = {
  get: function() {
    console.log('A value has been accessed');
  }
}

const initialObj = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Foo Bar'
}

const proxiedObj = new Proxy(initialObj, handler);

console.log(proxiedObj.name); 
```
Now, if we had not made a Proxy Object, calling `console.log(proxiedObj.name)` on Line 14 would've logged "*Foo Bar"* to the console.

But now that we've made a Proxy, the `get` operation has some custom logic that we have defined on Line 3.

Calling `console.log(proxiedObj.name)` will now actually log "*A value has been accessed"* to the console!

To the careful eye, you'd notice that there are actually two logs in the console. *"A value has been accessed"* and *undefined*. Why? 🤔

The default implementation of the `get` operator is to return the value stored in that key in the Object. Since we overrode it to just log a statement, the value is never returned, and hence the `console.log()` statement on line14 logs `undefined`.

Let's fix that!

The `get` operator takes two parameters --- the object itself and the property being accessed.
```javascript
const handler = {
  get: function(obj, prop) {
    console.log('A value has been accessed');
    return obj[prop]; // Return the value stored in the key being accessed
  }
}

const initialObj = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Foo Bar'
}

const proxiedObj = new Proxy(initialObj, handler);

console.log(proxiedObj.name);
```

That's better! 😄

This custom override that we provided for `get` is called a `trap` (loosely based on the [concept of operating system traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_(computing))). The handler object is basically an object with a set of traps that would trigger whenever an object property is being accessed.

Let's add a trap for `set` as well. We'll do the same thing --- any time a value is set, we'll log the property being modified, as well as the value being set for that key.

The `set` operator takes three arguments --- the object, the property being accessed and the value being set for that property.
```javascript
const handler = {
  get: function(obj, prop) {
    console.log('A value has been accessed');
    return obj[prop];
  },
  set: function(obj, prop, value) {
    console.log(`${prop} is being set to ${value}`);
  }
}

const initialObj = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Foo Bar'
}

const proxiedObj = new Proxy(initialObj, handler);

proxiedObj.age = 24
```

Here, the access being made at Line 18 will trigger the function defined at Line 6, which will log the property being accessed and the value being set.

## A Real-world Example

Say we have an object that defines a person
```javascript
const person = {
   id: 1,
   name: 'Foo Bar'
};
```

What if we want to make the `id` property of this object a *private* property. No one should be able to access this property via `person.id`, and if someone does, we need to throw an error. How would we do this?

Proxies to the rescue! 🎉👩‍🚒

All we need to do is create a Proxy of this object, and override the `get` operator to prevent us from accessing the `id` property!

```javascript
const handler = {
  get: function(obj, prop) {
    if (prop === 'id') { // Check if the id is being accessed
      throw new Error('Cannot access private properties!'); // Throw an error
    } else {
      return obj[prop]; // If it's not the id property, return it as usual
    }
  }
}

const person = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Foo Bar'
}

const proxiedPerson = new Proxy(person, handler);

console.log(proxiedPerson.id);
```

Here, in the trap we've created for `get`, we check if the property being accessed is the `id` property, and if so, we throw an error. Otherwise, we return the value as usual.

Private Propeties --- Console Output

Another neat use case for this is validations. By setting a `set` trap, we can add custom validation before we set the value. If the value does not conform to the validation, we can throw an error!

```javascript
const handler = {
  set: function(obj, prop, value) {
    if (typeof value !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Only string values can be stored in this object!');
    } else {
      obj[prop] = value;  
    }
  }
}

const obj = {};

const proxiedObj = new Proxy(obj, handler);

console.log(proxiedObj); // This will log an empty object 
proxiedObj.name = 'Foo Bar'; // This should be allowed
console.log(proxiedObj); // This will log an object with the name property set

proxiedObj.age = 24; // This will throw an error.
```

Custom Validation --- Console Output

In the above examples, we've seen the `get` and the `set` traps. There are actually a lot more traps that can be set. You can find the [entire list here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/proxy-object-javascript).

Proxy Objects only just came into my radar after going through [this article about them](https://davidwalsh.name/watch-object-changes?utm_source=blog.campvanilla.com), and I can already see the usefulness of them in the code I write everyday!]
